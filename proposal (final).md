# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO: Vidamon

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO: A pokemon battle simulator that closely resembles pokemon showdown, but it has our own twist to it.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO: A pokemon battle simulation with probably 20+ pokemon, each having their own individual moves and skills. The player will control the pokemon(PVP) and take turns hitting each other until a player loses all of his pokemon. The animations will probably be youtube video that resembles the moves name and some of the abilities will do special things. It will be ran on a game making software like unity or unreal engine, but if we have a better alternative we might change it later.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO: We will get the UI down and most of the movesets within a dictionary connecting everything together. That said, learning how to use softwares like unity/unreal engine might take a while and we might also need to learn another language making it time consuming but we can get most of the coding and UI for the battle sim down.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO: I think we can get running the game down but somethings might still be messed up.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO: I hope the game can work like how we intended it to work. All of the UI exist and the players will take turns battling each other making it feel like a real pokemon game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO: We will need to learn a lot of things for this project, for example learning how use game making softwares, probably learning a new language, get UI editing down. We will probably need to get super fimilar with using the dictionaries. We will need to research pokemon movesets, what they do, what special abilities do they have, and the damage they do, basically everything you need to know about pokemon. I think we won't really be splitting work, since this project is decently big, we will just do what we know and help each other along the way until the project is finished.
